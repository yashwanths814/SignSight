# ✋ SignSight

**AI-powered gesture control for browsers. No mouse. No keyboard. Just you.**
---

## 🚀 Inspiration

With the rise of gesture-based interfaces and the growing need for hygienic, accessible tech, **SignSight** was created to reimagine how users interact with their monitors. Our goal: simple hand signs to perform everyday actions—perfect for touch-free computing and inclusive design.


## 🧠 What It Does

SignSight is a **web-based application** that uses your **webcam** to detect and interpret hand gestures in real time. Recognized gestures trigger system-level actions such as:

- Scrolling webpages
- Switching browser tabs
- Adjusting volume
- Brightness control
- Even initiating shutdown!

All within the browser — no downloads, no backend setup.


## 🎮 Gesture Control Guide

### 🚦 Getting Started

1. **Allow camera access** when prompted by your browser  
2. **Position your hand clearly** within the webcam view  
3. **Hold gestures for 1–2 seconds**  
4. **Wait for recognition** and action execution  
5. **No gesture detected?** — System auto-stops interaction

## 🛠️ How We Built It

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Real-Time Gesture Detection**: [MediaPipe Hands](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands.html) + [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js)  
- **UI/UX**: Responsive layout, smooth CSS animations, intuitive feedback  
- **Architecture**: Single-page, browser-native app — no server required  

Gesture classification and trigger mappings handled client-side for minimal latency.


## 🏆 Accomplishments

- Functional gesture control that runs entirely in-browser  
- Seamless blend of computer vision and responsive UI  
- No backend dependencies — completely client-side  
- Optimized for smooth, low-latency interaction
